## Game Logic

- Players take turns in the order they were added
- Each turn, a player enters 3 individual scores
- The sum of these 3 scores becomes the turn total
- Turn totals are added to the player's cumulative score
- Game ends when any player reaches or exceeds the target score
- Winner is automatically declared
- Game can be reset at any time
- Current turn progress is tracked with visual indicators
